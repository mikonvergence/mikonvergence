My name is Mikolaj Czerkawski, I am a Research Fellow at the European Space Agency.

My research interests involve **computer vision**, **signal processing**, and **machine learning**.

A recurring theme in my works is the context of learning in data-limited settings. The topics I tend to deal with include:

* 🍱 Multi-Modal Learning
* 🎨 Generative Models
* 🖼 Image Synthesis and Manipulation
* 🔬 Image Super-Resolution
* 🌆➡🌃Image-to-Image Translation
* 🔎 Model Robustness Assessment
* 🛰 Computer Vision for Remote Sensing Applications
* 🔊 Computer Vision for Radar Signal Processing

My research involves applying computer vision techniques to real-world applications where (i) the datasets are small or (ii) high risk of poor generalization exists. So far, this has primarily been done with short-range radar data and with satellite imagery.
